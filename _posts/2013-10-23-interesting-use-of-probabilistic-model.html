In these lecture the presenter describes a system of differential equation that is solved for a set of initial condition. &nbsp; The results are used to build a probabilistic model, using the distribution of values and the probability model for state transitions in a dynamic model. &nbsp; The dynamic network is then used to make inference on the system directly with out needing to solve the differential equation.<br /><br />An interesting side note is that with deterministic differential equation describing a system (in this case a biological system) our observation of the state of the system is noisy and infrequent (once every 30 minutes). &nbsp; Further justifying the probabilistic approach over a deterministic approach.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kKrlydBP7fo" width="420"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E3FdGS9eI-s" width="420"></iframe><br /><br /><br />
