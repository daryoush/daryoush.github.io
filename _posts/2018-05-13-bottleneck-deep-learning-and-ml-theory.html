The A<a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/09/28/anatomize-deep-learning-with-information-theory.html">natomize deep learning with information theory</a>&nbsp;is a nice summary of the bottleneck theory and deep learning talk by Professor Tishby.&nbsp; &nbsp;The blog also has a nice reference to a two part&nbsp;write up on traditional learning theory that doesn't actually explain the success the deep learning: Tutorial on ML theory,&nbsp;<a href="https://mostafa-samir.github.io/ml-theory-pt1/" >part1</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://mostafa-samir.github.io/ml-theory-pt2/" >part 2</a>.  <br/></br>Update:   A really interesting article on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-remember-the-brain-must-actively-forget-20180724/">To Remember, the Brain Must Actively Forget</a>  This is very similar to the idea of the bottleneck theory and deep learning models.
