The 2nd paragraph of the Shannon's <a href="http://math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf">A Mathematical Theory of Communication paper</a> says:    <blockquote>The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.</blockquote>   BACHELIER's The <a href="http://http://www.radio.goldseek.com/bachelier-thesis-theory-of-speculation-en.pdf">THE THEORY OF SPECULATION</a> paper that started the Finance theory starts off with:  <blockquote>The determination of these fluctuations is subject to an infinite number of factors: it is therefore impossible to expect a mathematically exact forecast. Contradictory opinions in regard to these fluctuations are so divided that at the same instant buyers believe the market is rising and sellers that it is falling. Undoubtedly, the Theory of Probability will never be applicable to the movements of quoted prices and the dynamics of the Stock Exchange will never be an exact science. However, it is possible to study mathematically the static state of the market at a given instant, that is to say, to establish the probability law for the price fluctuations that the market admits at this instant. Indeed, while the market does not foresee fluctuations, it considers which of them are more or less probable, and this probability can be evaluated mathematically.</blockquote>
