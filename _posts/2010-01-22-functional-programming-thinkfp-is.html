In many of the articles/books on Category Theory the Category theory is explained in terms of mathematical concepts of Rings, Sets, Fields...  I have been struggling to see how it all relate to functional programming.   So this might be useful for others too...<br /><br />In section 2.2 this <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.172&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Category Theory lecture notes</a>  there is an interesting explanation of explaning how functional programming forms a category.
