The posting for PhD student position in Ultrech University in Holland seem to have the  best description of functional programming I have seen:<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote>Lambda-calculus and term rewriting are models of computation lying at the basis of functional programming languages. Both possess syntactic meta-theories based on analyzing rewrite steps.</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.nabble.com/Ph.D-position,-Utrecht-University,-the-Netherlands-td25348561.html">Source</a>
