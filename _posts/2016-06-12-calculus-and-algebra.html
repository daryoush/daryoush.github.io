I thin this video capture the essence of calculus. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://youtu.be/rtEk1at3sVk?t=27m49s">https://youtu.be/rtEk1at3sVk?t=27m49s</a></div><br />"We have a geometric concept, and we want an algebraic expression for it".<br /><br />It could be: we have XYZ concept, and &nbsp;want and algebraic expression for it. <br /><br />An XYZ calculus (such as Tensor calculus in case of Geometry, differential calculus in case of algebra, Relational Calculus in case of Relational Algebra, Lambda Calculus in case of Function algebra...) &nbsp;is &nbsp;used to write an algebraic expression which is then solved with algebraic laws to reason. &nbsp; <br /><br />The method seems to always be "Write down the correct identity"... &nbsp;Struggling to find how this applies to Lambda Calculus..
