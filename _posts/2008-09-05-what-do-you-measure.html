In questing Gross Domestic Product(GDP) measurements as valid health economic indicator, Martin Collier  of the Glaser Progress Foundation says:<br /><br /><blockquote>The most simple way to put it is you are what you measure, you get what you measure, and you fix what you measure. It's time to measure what matters most, it's time to measure what we value most, instead of simply valuing what we measure. <a href="http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=1172">Source</a></blockquote><br /><br />Interesting...You {are, get, fix} what you measure.
