I am watching a nice set of lectures of Harvard's Stat 110 class.      <br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0TUsc4p5fk&list=PLLVplP8OIVc-dyucgFAPwoElDFhCCEZ7v">Watch the Lectures</a> <br/>Professor Joe Blitzstein is great.   One particularly puzzling problem is presented at 36:00 minute of  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xq6ROBVYPQ">Stat 123 teaser.</a> <br/>I have not been able to figure out the puzzle in the expected value of Euro and $.   If you happen to have any ideas on this I would appreciate it.
