<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">......what does it mean for one library to be more "high level" or "low<br />level" or "functional" than another? On what basis should we make such<br />comparisons? A pithy answer is given by Perlis:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">A programming language is low level when its programs require attention<br />to the irrelevant.<br />Alan Perlis</blockquote><b>But how should we decide what is relevant?</b></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Within the functional programming community, there is a strong historical<br />connection between functional programming and <b>formal modeling</b>.<br />Many authors have expressed the view that functional programming languages<br />are "high level" because they allow programs to be written in terms of an<br /><b>abstract conceptual model</b> of the problem domain, without undue concern for<br />implementation details.</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Of course, although functional languages <b>can</b> be used in this "high level"<br />way, this is neither a requirement nor a guarantee. It is very easy to write<br />programs and libraries in pure Haskell that are littered with implementation<br />details and bear little or no resemblance to any abstract conceptual model of<br />the problem they were written to solve</blockquote><br />Source <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/genuinely-functional-guis.pdf">Genuinely Functional User Interfaces</a><br />
