I had hard time understanding the common practice in haskell of MonadXXX class relationship with XXX type (e.g. MonadReader  and Reader) until I run into this line:<br /><br />The MonadWriter class provides a number of convenience functions for working with Writer monads.  In the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/all_about_monads/html/writermonad.html">Writer Monad tutorial</a>.   <br /><br />Looking at the class interfaces as "convenience functions" to work with underlying type is interesting way of looking at it.
