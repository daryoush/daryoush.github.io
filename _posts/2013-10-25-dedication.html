In "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lady-Tasting-Tea-Revolutionized/dp/0805071342">The Lady Tasting Tea</a>" the author (David Salsburg) talks about calculations done in a Statistical <a href="http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15170/1/15.pdf">paper</a> published in 1920s by R. A Fisher. &nbsp; Mind blowing to think that he used this machine to do the tables and charts in the paper:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/r9Nnl-u-Xf8" width="420"></iframe><br /><br />The author estimates it must have taken him 185 hours to prepare the tables.
