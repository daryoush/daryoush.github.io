In Wikipedia Domain Specific Language is defined as:  <br /><blockquote><br />a programming language or specification<br />language dedicated to a particular problem<br />domain, a particular problem representation<br />technique, and/or a particular solution technique</blockquote><br /><br />I have been looking for a better "frame", I may have found one.<br /><br /> I was  looking at <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/Hagl_JFP09.pdf">A domain-specific language for experimental<br />game theory</a> paper.  And this <a href="http://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/archive/ou/tutorial_7/tutorial07.htm">Tutorial</a> in game theory had a sentence that best captured the "DSL think" that I am looking for.   On 2nd slide it says:<br /><br /><blockquote>"To analyze strategic behavior we need the <span style="font-weight:bold;">conceptual tool<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span> of game theory..."</blockquote><br /><br />A DSL is essentially allows you to apply the conceptual tools to your domain.  The tools in turn need the underlying data in format that is also covered in your DSL.
