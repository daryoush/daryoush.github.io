The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00810">Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks via Information</a> uses the diffusion process and heat equation as intuition for gradient flow between the layers of the deep network.  I needed a refresher on the underlying math.   Found some very good sources: <br/><br/>In "<a href="https://youtu.be/4J74tquQ7jU">What is Laplacian</a>" and subsequent video you get a great insightful introduction of Laplacian, heat and wave equations.     <br/><br/> In the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015/differential-equations-and-linear-algebra/applied-mathematics-and-ata/">applied math section</a> which continues to <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015/differential-equations-and-linear-algebra/fourier-and-laplace-transforms/">"Fourier and Laplace Transformation"</a> section of the differential equation lecture series, there is also a shorter explanation of diffusion.   <br/><br/> There is also stochastic nature to the whole thing that is nicely covered in the Stochastic process, Ito calculus , and stochastic differential equation section of the  Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance lectures with <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/lecture-notes/">Notes</a> and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/video-lectures/">Vidoes</a>.
