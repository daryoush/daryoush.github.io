Interesting talks on use of Haskell in Barclays for mission critical applications. &nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/haskell-barclays#.VB4tYkY5ZB4.blogger">Haskell at Barclays: Exotic Tools for Exotic Trades</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The section about Generic programming using Catamorphisms and &nbsp;Sharing of computations is quite interesting. &nbsp; I also like the idea of Barclays first developed an EDSL then a DSL that it compiled to the EDSL. &nbsp; Having a DSL allows you to give application specific error messages that would be difficult when you have EDSL in a mother language (in this case Haskell). &nbsp; &nbsp;I also liked their mention of the UUParsing library out of Utrecht. &nbsp; There is an interesting <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/doaitse-swierstra/combinator-parsing-tutorial.pdf">tutorial</a>&nbsp; (and <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/foswiki/pub/USCS/CourseSchedule/C10-ParserCombinators-final.pdf">class notes</a>) on the parser that I have been studying and find it very useful in &nbsp;trying to learn functional thinking and design.
