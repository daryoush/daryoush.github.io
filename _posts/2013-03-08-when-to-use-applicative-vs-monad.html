A nice rule of &nbsp;as to when you must use Monad and when you can use Applicative style:<br /><br /><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11702411/2150182">How do you use Control.Applicative to write cleaner Haskell?</a><br /><br /><br />Update: &nbsp; May be another way to look at this is to think of &gt;&gt;= as combinator that applies the mapping function then &nbsp;flattens the result of application of &nbsp;(a -&gt; mb), and (in some implementations) change the computation based on the value of the "a". &nbsp; In computations where the &gt;&gt;= is only flattening the types, it can be converted to an Applicative computation. <br /><br /><br />
